  Last updated 2022-06-07

This project is intended for my own use, I've have not really focused on making this reusable for others. 

However I have documented my build process and share it here. The design is creted for 2 scales and 2 
displays but it will work if you only use one. 

The project contains the following parts:

* Software that manage the scale and present the readings.
* Hardware design based on standard HX711 AD converter with load cells.
* 3D models for the base and display case.
